## Regional

### Mediterranean 

The data suggests that the Mediterranean is the site where the majority of migrants die or go missing.

```

Of the 34,688 people who died or went missing on their journeys, 55.6% of them died in the Mediterranean.

### US-Mexico Border

A large number of migrants have also died near the US-Mexico border. In total, 2,405 migrants have died or gone missing in this area, making it the third most dangerous region in the world for migrants. It is only surpassed by the Mediterranean and North Africa.

This region is worth exploring because it has experienced an upsurge in both migration and migrant deaths in the past few years. Since 2014 (the first year data was collected), the region has observed a 62% increase in migrant deaths. 

In 2019, 497 migrants died or went missing near the US-Mexico border.

There are, unsurprisingly, concentrations around the border itself. 

But there are two places--inside the U.S.--which have an abnormal concentration of unaccounted for migrants.  

### Southern Arizona

One of these areas is southern Arizona. Cities such as Tucson and Sierra Vista witness much migration from the US-Mexico border, and much of it leads to treacherous outcomes. In 2018, the remains of 127 migrants were <a target = '_blank' href = "https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/border-issues/2019/01/16/remains-127-dead-migrants-recovered-southern-arizona-2018/2575080002/">given to the Pima County Medical Examiner's Office</a>.

### Brooks County

The other is in the Southeastern part of Texas. There are deaths scattered throughout, but the greatest concentration is in one place: Brooks County. Over <a target = '_blank' href = 'https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/05/04/us/texas-border-migrants-dead-bodies.html'>500 migrants' remains</a> have been found in this county since 2009.
